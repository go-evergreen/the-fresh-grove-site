    psychology: "Curiosity is an information gap. Once someone knows a specific unanswered detail exists, not knowing it feels uncomfortable. Vague mystery reads as bait. A concrete unfinished moment reads as a story mid-telling.",
    template: "One specific true moment + how it landed on you + a soft hold-back (\"more soon\" / \"still sitting with this\"). Don't resolve the whole thing in one post.",
    example: "I stayed up way too late reading about a skincare company I'd never heard of. One detail stopped me cold — and I'm still sitting with it.",
    classy_rule: "The payoff has to be real later. One curiosity post at a time. If you tease everything and deliver nothing, people mute you.",

    psychology: "People don't argue with stories the way they argue with claims. A documented journey (learning, doubting, deciding) builds trust that a product shot can't.",
    template: "What you're doing right now + what surprised you + what you're still unsure about. Present tense. Leave the rough edges in.",
    example: "Currently: learning about an Austrian company that makes fresh cosmetics without synthetic preservatives as the shortcut. Surprised by how much the expiry date actually matters. Still figuring out how to talk about it without sounding weird.",
    classy_rule: "Show real uncertainty. Perfect \"day in the life\" edits feel like ads. A half-formed thought feels like a friend.",

    psychology: "Praise that includes a limitation is rated more credible than pure praise. Specificity does the same work — \"soft after 12 hours\" beats \"life-changing.\"",
    template: "What you tried + the one thing you actually noticed + when you noticed it + one caveat (who it's NOT for, or what surprised you).",
    example: "Honest note on the cleanser: takes makeup off with just a washcloth and my skin doesn't feel tight after. Caveat — if you love a big foamy lather, this isn't that. It's more of a milk.",

    works_today: "Identity posts drive follows and shares. When someone agrees with your standard, your later posts feel like consistency — not a pitch. Great as a carousel opinion or a short talking-head Reel.",
    psychology: "People commit to identities more than purchases. Agreeing with your bar (\"ingredients should need no apology\") makes saying yes later feel like staying true to themselves.",
    template: "A belief about products / ingredients / wellness + why you hold it + zero selling, zero links, zero CTA.",
    example: "Unpopular-ish opinion: \"natural\" on a label doesn't tell me much. I want to know who made it, why each ingredient is there, and whether they'd put it on their own kid. That's the bar for me.",

    psychology: "A single small ask starts a real conversation. Moving from the feed into messages is where trust builds. Two CTAs compete and both lose.",
    template: "Quick true context + exactly one action + what they get + explicit no-pressure language.",
    example: "I've been researching a wellness company that keeps answering my questions the deeper I look. If you'd like to follow along while I share what I'm learning, drop a 🌱 below — happy to bring you along. No pressure either way.",
